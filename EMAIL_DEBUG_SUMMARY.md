# 📊 Email Troubleshooting Summary

## Issue Detected:
No EmailJS logs found in Logcat after complaint submission. This indicates the email function is not executing.

## Possible Causes:

### 1. ⚠️ OkHttp Library Not Downloaded
**Most Likely**: Gradle didn't sync properly and OkHttp library wasn't downloaded.

**Fix**: 
```powershell
# In Android Studio terminal or external PowerShell:
cd "c:\Users\ayush\Desktop\ACADEMICS\SEMESTER 6\Project_Sem_6\Simulation\RailSafetyApp"
.\gradlew clean build
```

### 2. 🔧 Function Not Being Called
The sendNotificationToMaintainer() might be failing before it calls sendEmailViaEmailJS().

**Check**: Look for this log in your Logcat:
```
MainActivity: Notification sent to maintainer for complaint: [ID]
```

If you DON'T see this log, it means Firebase notification failed and email function never got called.

### 3. 📱 Network Security Configuration
Android might be blocking HTTP requests.

## 🎯 Next Steps:

### Step 1: Rebuild the App
1. In Android Studio: **Build** → **Clean Project**
2. Then: **Build** → **Rebuild Project**
3. Wait for Gradle sync to complete
4. Run the app again

### Step 2: Check for Firebase Logs
Look for this exact log after submitting complaint:
```
MainActivity: Notification sent to maintainer for complaint: -NXXXXXXXXX
```

If you see this log, it means Firebase succeeded but email failed.
If you DON'T see this log, Firebase write is failing.

### Step 3: Submit Another Test Complaint
After rebuilding, submit another complaint and share:
- ALL logs from the moment you click "Submit"
- Look specifically for "MainActivity" and "EmailJS" tags

## 🔍 What I Need From You:

After rebuilding and testing again, tell me:
1. Do you see: `Notification sent to maintainer for complaint: [ID]` ?
2. Do you see: `🔄 Preparing to send email for complaint: [ID]` ?
3. Do you see ANY error messages?

This will help me pinpoint the exact issue!
