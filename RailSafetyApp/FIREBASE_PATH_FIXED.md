# ✅ FIXED - Firebase Data Path Updated

## What Was Changed:

### Before (Wrong):
```kotlin
private val logsRef = database.getReference("logs")
private val storedLogsRef = database.getReference("storedLogs")
```

### After (Correct):
```kotlin
private val logsRef = database.getReference("RailwayGate/current")
private val storedLogsRef = database.getReference("RailwayGate/history")
```

## Your Firebase Structure:

From your screenshot, I can see:
```
RailwayGate/
  └── current/
      ├── datetime: "2025-10-27 10:02:31"
      ├── direction: "S3->S1"
      ├── event: "train_detected"
      ├── gate_status: "closing"
      ├── sensor: 3
      └── timestamp: 1761539551
```

The app now reads from **`RailwayGate/current`** for real-time data!

## 🚀 Next Steps:

1. **Clean & Rebuild** your project:
   ```
   Build → Clean Project
   Build → Rebuild Project
   ```

2. **Run the app**

3. **Expected Logcat Output:**
   ```
   D/RailwayCrossingRepo: Setting up Firebase listeners for Railway Crossing
   D/RailwayCrossingRepo: Listening to path: RailwayGate/current/
   D/RailwayCrossingRepo: onDataChange called - data exist: true
   D/RailwayCrossingRepo: Current railway data found
   D/RailwayCrossingRepo:   datetime = 2025-10-27 10:02:31
   D/RailwayCrossingRepo:   direction = S3->S1
   D/RailwayCrossingRepo:   event = train_detected
   D/RailwayCrossingRepo:   gate_status = closing
   D/RailwayCrossingRepo:   sensor = 3
   D/RailwayCrossingRepo: Parsed - Event: train_detected, Gate: closing
   D/RailwayCrossingRepo: UI Updated - Train: Train Approaching, Gate: Closing
   
   D/HomeFragment: Train Status updated: Train Approaching
   D/HomeFragment: Gate Status updated: Closing
   ```

4. **Expected App UI:**
   ```
   ┌─────────────────────────────┐
   │ Railway Crossing Status     │
   ├─────────────────────────────┤
   │ Train Status                │
   │ Train Approaching ✅         │
   │                             │
   │ Gate Status                 │
   │ Closing ✅                   │
   │                             │
   │ Current Speed               │
   │ 0.00 km/h                   │
   │                             │
   │ ETA to Gate                 │
   │ 0.00 sec                    │
   │                             │
   │ Last Updated                │
   │ 11:05:32 PM ✅               │
   └─────────────────────────────┘
   ```

## 📝 Notes:

### Speed & ETA:
Your Firebase doesn't currently have `speed` or `eta` fields, so they'll show `0.00`.

**To add speed/eta to Firebase:**
Update your MicroPython/ESP32 code to send:
```python
data = {
    "event": "train_detected",
    "gate_status": "closing",
    "speed": 45.5,      # Add this
    "eta": 25.3,        # Add this
    "datetime": current_time,
    "timestamp": timestamp
}
```

### Event Log:
The app now looks for event history in `RailwayGate/history/`

**Create this structure in Firebase:**
```
RailwayGate/
  └── history/
      ├── -entry1
      │   ├── datetime: "2025-10-27 10:02:31"
      │   ├── event: "train_detected"
      │   └── gate_status: "closing"
      ├── -entry2
      │   └── ...
```

## ✅ Summary:

**FIXED:**
- ✅ Reading from correct Firebase path (`RailwayGate/current`)
- ✅ Handling your actual Firebase field names
- ✅ Real-time updates will work now!

**RUN THE APP NOW!** 🚀

Your data should appear immediately!
