## 📋 Complete Feature Flow

```
1. User taps FAB button
        ↓
2. Dialog appears with:
   - Email input (optional)
   - Phone input (optional)
   - Details input (required)
   - Complaint type selection (radio buttons)
        ↓
3. User fills form and taps "Submit"
        ↓
4. submitComplaint() is called:
   - Saves to Firebase: /complaints/[push-id]
   - Data includes: type, details, timestamp, status, userEmail, userPhone
        ↓
5. On Firebase success:
   - Shows Toast: "✅ Complaint submitted successfully"

   - Sends via Transport.send()
   - Logs each step for debugging
        ↓
8. Result displayed to user:

## 🧪 Testing Instructions

### Prerequisites
1. Ensure JavaMail dependencies are in `build.gradle`:
   ```gradle
   implementation 'com.sun.mail:android-mail:1.6.7'
   implementation 'com.sun.mail:android-activation:1.6.7'
   ```

2. Verify internet permission in `AndroidManifest.xml`:
   ```xml
   <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET" />
   ```

3. Check Gmail credentials in MainActivity.kt:
   ```kotlin
   private val SENDER_EMAIL = "ayushkumar823932@gmail.com"
   private val SENDER_PASSWORD = "hokrnsfxtiucscxz"  // Gmail App Password
   private val MAINTAINER_EMAIL = "ayushrskiaa@gmail.com"
   ```

### Test Steps

1. **Build the App**
   ```
   In Android Studio: Build → Rebuild Project
   ```

2. **Run on Device/Emulator**
   ```
   Run → Run 'app'
   ```

3. **Open Logcat**
   ```
   View → Tool Windows → Logcat
   Filter by: EmailSMTP
   ```

4. **Submit a Test Complaint**
   - Tap the FAB (Floating Action Button)
   - Fill in:
     * Email: test@example.com (optional)
     * Phone: 1234567890 (optional)
     * Details: "Test complaint message" (required)
   - Select complaint type: "Gate Malfunction"
   - Tap "Submit"

5. **Monitor Logcat Output**
   You should see:
   ```
   D/EmailSMTP: 📤 Starting SMTP email send...
   D/EmailSMTP: Sender: ayushkumar823932@gmail.com → Recipient: ayushrskiaa@gmail.com
   D/EmailSMTP: ✅ Creating mail session...
   D/EmailSMTP: ✅ Creating message...
   D/EmailSMTP: ✅ Connecting to SMTP server...
   D/EmailSMTP: ✅ Email sent successfully!
   ```

6. **Check Results**
   - Firebase Console: Verify complaint saved in `/complaints` node
   - Email Inbox: Check ayushrskiaa@gmail.com for email
   - App Toast: Should show "📧 Email sent successfully to maintainer!"

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Authentication failed"
**Logcat Error:**
```
E/EmailSMTP: ❌ Authentication failed: ...
E/EmailSMTP: 💡 Check: 1) App Password is correct 2) 2-Step Verification is enabled
```

**Solutions:**
1. Go to Google Account → Security
2. Enable 2-Step Verification
3. Generate new App Password:
   - Google Account → Security → 2-Step Verification → App passwords
   - Select "Mail" and your device
   - Copy the 16-character password (remove spaces)
4. Update `SENDER_PASSWORD` in MainActivity.kt

### Issue: "Network error"
**Logcat Error:**
```
E/EmailSMTP: ❌ Network error: Cannot reach smtp.gmail.com
E/EmailSMTP: 💡 Check: Internet connection
```

**Solutions:**
1. Check device/emulator internet connection
2. Try switching WiFi/Mobile Data
3. Test with browser: Can you open gmail.com?
4. Check if port 587 is blocked by firewall

### Issue: "Connection timed out"
**Logcat Error:**
```
E/EmailSMTP: ❌ Timeout: Connection timed out
E/EmailSMTP: 💡 Check: Network speed and firewall settings
```

**Solutions:**
1. Check network speed (slow connection)
2. Increase timeout values in code:
   ```kotlin
   put("mail.smtp.connectiontimeout", "20000")  // 20 seconds
   put("mail.smtp.timeout", "20000")
   put("mail.smtp.writetimeout", "20000")
   ```
3. Try different network
4. Check firewall/antivirus settings

### Issue: "Email saved but not sent"
**Toast Message:**
```
⚠️ Email failed, but complaint saved in database
```

**What This Means:**
- Complaint successfully saved to Firebase
- Email sending failed (check Logcat for specific error)
- User's data is safe, email can be retried manually

**Next Steps:**
1. Filter Logcat by "EmailSMTP" to see specific error
2. Follow troubleshooting steps for that specific error
3. Manually check Firebase Console for the saved complaint

## 📊 Firebase Data Structure

Complaints are saved in this structure:

```json
{
  "complaints": {
    "-NxYz123abc456": {
      "type": "Gate Malfunction",
      "details": "Gate not closing properly",
      "timestamp": "2025-10-29 14:30:45",
      "status": "pending",
      "userEmail": "user@example.com",
      "userPhone": "+1234567890"
    },
    "-NxYz789def012": {
      "type": "Sensor Issue",
      "details": "Sensor showing wrong readings",
      "timestamp": "2025-10-29 15:45:20",
      "status": "pending",
      "userEmail": "Not provided",
      "userPhone": "Not provided"
    }
  }
}
```

## 🔒 Security Notes

⚠️ **IMPORTANT**: The current implementation has hardcoded credentials in source code.

**Current State:**
- Email: `ayushkumar823932@gmail.com`
- Password: `hokrnsfxtiucscxz` (App Password)
- Acceptable for: Academic projects, demos, prototypes

**For Production Apps:**
1. **Never commit credentials** to version control
2. **Use environment variables** in `gradle.properties`:
   ```properties
   SENDER_EMAIL=your-email@gmail.com
   SENDER_PASSWORD=your-app-password
   ```
3. **Use backend service** for email sending:
   ```
   Android App → API Server → Email Service → Send Email
   ```
4. **Consider Firebase Cloud Functions:**
   ```javascript
   exports.sendComplaintEmail = functions.database
     .ref('/complaints/{complaintId}')
     .onCreate((snapshot, context) => {
       // Send email using Nodemailer
     });
   ```
